<h3 align="center">VC++ Project Compare v1.0</h3>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>
This utility allows you to compare the project settings of your Visual C++
projects so that you can easily find inconsistencies. These differences could
be as simple as forgetting to "Suppress Startup Banner" when compiling to
potentially more serious settings such as the "Buffer Security Check".
</p><p>
The program supports Visual C++ 7.0 upwards, i.e. any version that uses the
XML format project files.
</p>

<h5>Comparing Projects</h5>

<p>
You can select the project files to compare in two ways. The first is to select
a folder and the program will search for all project files (*.vcproj) in that
and any subfolders. You will be shown a list of the files found first so that you
can refine it before continuing. The alternative is to just pick two specific
files and compare those. You use the radio buttons at the top of the main view
to switch between these two mechanisms.
</p><p>
Once you have chosen your folder or files you can either use "File | List All
Settings" to just see all the project settings that are contained within the
project files, or you can use "File | Compare Settings" to perform a comparison.
At this point, if you chose to find all files in a folder you will be presented
with a list of the files found and you can choose to exclude some.
</p><p>
Then the project files will be parsed and the results displayed in the lower
grid. The results table is sorted according to the orderof the main columns,
i.e. Tool, Setting and then Build Configuration.
