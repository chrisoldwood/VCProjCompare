<h3 align="center">VC++ Project Compare v0.8</h3>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>
This utility allows you to compare the project settings of your Visual C++
projects so that you can easily find inconsistencies. These differences could
be as simple as forgetting to "Suppress Startup Banner" when compiling to
potentially more serious settings such as the "Buffer Security Check".
</p><p>
The program supports Visual C++ 7.0 upwards, i.e. any version that uses the
XML format project files.
</p>

<a name="Comparing"></a>
<h5>Comparing Projects</h5>

<p>
You can select the project files to compare in two ways. The first is to select
a folder and the program will search for all project files (*.vcproj) in that
and any subfolders. You will be shown a list of the files found first so that you
can refine it before continuing. The alternative is to just pick two specific
files and compare those. You use the radio buttons at the top of the main view
to switch between these two mechanisms.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Once you have chosen your folder or files you can either use "File | List All
Settings" to just see all the project settings that are contained within the
project files, or you can use "File | Compare Settings" to perform a comparison.
At this point, if you chose to find all files in a folder you will be presented
with a list of the files found and you can choose to exclude some.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Then the project files will be parsed and the results displayed in the lower
grid. The results table is sorted according to the order of the main columns,
i.e. Tool, Setting and then Build Configuration.
</p><p>

</p><p>
If you chose to run a comparison, then you will see only those settings that
are different from what the 'common' setting is. The common setting is deemed
the one the occurs mostly frequently. If all projects have the same setting it
wont be displayed at all. To show what the 'common' setting is a special row
appears with an '*' for the filename and path.

<h5>Removing Noise</h5>

<p>
The first time you run a comparison you will likely see that a number of
settings can't be compared directly because they vary wildy, e.g.
AdditionalIncludeDirectotories. The other common issue is settings that differ
between build configurations, e.g. RuntimeLibray. If you right-click on the
results view you will see a context menu,
</p><p>
<img src="ContextMenu.gif" align="top">
</p><p>
The first option allows you to ignore this project setting altogether, and the
second will compare it on a per build confuration basis, i.e. separately for
Debug and Release. If the context menu is grayed out it means that one or other
setting is already in effect. If you make a mistake you can edit the list of
special settings through the "Tools | Options..." dialog.
</p>

<h5>Refreshing The Results</h5>

<p>
Once you have worked through the differences, either by fixing the project files
or by marking the setting as build dependent or to be ignored you can refresh
the list of settings, or comparison results, by using "File | Refresh" or
pressing F5.
